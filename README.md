Sometimes devs implement a MaxTransaction into a token which prevents you from purchasing over that amount.

The purpose of this contract is so that you can send however much ETH you want to spend and the contract will purchase the token for you and then
break it down into multiple smaller transactions bypassing the maxtransaction limit.

The tokens will then be sent to the wallet address you specified.
